                    <b>Stefan Uros IV Dusan Nemanjic</b>, also known as Stefan Dusan or Dusan Silni, 
                    was the last Serbian king of the Nemanjic dynasty, ruling from 1331 to 1346, 
                    and then became the first emperor of the Serbian state when he was resurrected on 16 16. 
                    April 1, 1346 crowned the first Serbian Patriarch Joanikije II. Dušan ruled the newly 
                    formed Serbian Empire for 9 years - from his coronation in 1346 until his death on 
                    December 20, 1355. Emperor Dušan is described as an energetic ruler, of a strong character 
                    and temperament, which is why he is often called "Dušan Silni". In 1349 he brought a very 
                    important document, called the Dusan Code, and it was written in Serbian. 
                    Dusan's imperial crown is today in the Cetinje Monastery, Montenegro. 
                    Emperor Dusan is also known for building the Monastery of the Holy Archangels near Prizren, 
                    where he was buried until 1927, when his body was transferred to the Church of St. Mark in Belgrade. 
                    He also completed the endowment of his father, the High Dečani Monastery. 
                    Dušan is considered a hero among today's Serbs, and he has great respect in the people.

                    <b>Nikola Tesla</b> was one of the most famous Serbian and world inventors and scientists in the field of physics, 
                    electrical engineering and radio engineering. Tesla's most significant inventions are a polyphase system, 
                    a rotating magnetic field, an induction motor, a synchronous motor and a Tesla transformer. 
                    He also discovered one of the ways to generate high-frequency current, made a significant contribution 
                    to the transmission and modulation of radio signals, and his work in the field of X-rays was also noted. 
                    Its AC system has made it possible to transmit electricity remotely much more easily and efficiently. 
                    He was a key man in the construction of the first hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls. 
                    He passed away at the age of 87, poor and forgotten. It is the only Serb named after an 
                    international unit of measure, a unit of measure for magnetic flux density or magnetic field strength - tesla. 
                    Nikola Tesla is the author of more than 700 patents registered in 25 countries, 
                    of which 112 are in the field of electrical engineering. <br><br>
