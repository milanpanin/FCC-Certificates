# Free Code Camp Certificates

After thinking about whether to start the FCC challenge, I finally got some free time and decided to go through this course. I have to admit, it is very interesting to move from one challenge to another and to show the acquired knowledge through projects at the end of the course. After successfully completing the course, besides the rewards of the knowledge acquired there is a reward in the form of certificates. On average, each of the certificates required about 300 hours of coding. <br /> 

This repository represents my hard work and the success I have achieved over a multi-months adventure on FreeCodeCamp. <br/>


Some of the available projects that I created in order to obtain the certificate can be viewed at the following link: https://codepen.io/collection/DboBPW?grid_type=list. <br/>
