# FCC-Projects

My FreeCodeCamp project are organized in branches!! <br /> <br /> 


After thinking about whether to start the FCC challenge, I finally got some free time and decided to go through this course. I have to admit, it is very interesting to move from one challenge to another and to show the acquired knowledge through projects at the end of the course. After successfully completing the course, besides the rewards of the knowledge acquired there is a reward in the form of certificates. <br /> 

This repository represents my hard work and the success I have achieved over a multi-week adventure on FreeCodeCamp.
